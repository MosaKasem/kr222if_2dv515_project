Proto-Austronesian languageFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchThe Proto-Austronesian language (PAN) is the reconstructed ancestor of the Austronesian languages, one of the world's major language families.Lower-level reconstructions have also been made, and include Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian. Recently, linguists such as Malcolm Ross and Andrew Pawley have built large lexicons for Proto-Oceanic and Proto-Polynesian.Contents1 Phonology1.1 Blust's reconstruction1.2 Wolff's reconstruction1.3 Other reconstructions2 Sound changes3 Syntax3.1 Word order3.2 Voice system3.3 Interrogatives and case markers4 Morphology4.1 Affixes4.2 Reduplication5 Vocabulary5.1 Pronouns5.2 Nouns5.3 Colors and directions5.4 Numerals5.5 Verbs6 Monosyllabic roots7 See also8 Further reading9 Notes and references9.1 Notes9.2 References10 External linksPhonology[edit]Proto-Austronesian is reconstructed by constructing sets of correspondences among consonants in the various Austronesian languages, according to the comparative method.  Although in theory the result should be unambiguous, in practice given the large number of languages there are numerous disagreements, with various scholars differing significantly on the number and nature of the phonemes in Proto-Austronesian.  In the past, some disagreements concerned whether certain correspondence sets were real or represent sporadic developments in particular languages.  For the currently remaining disagreements, however, scholars generally accept the validity of the correspondence sets but disagree on the extent to which the distinctions in these sets can be projected back to proto-Austronesian or represent innovations in particular sets of daughter languages.Blust's reconstruction[edit]Below are Proto-Austronesian phonemes reconstructed by Robert Blust, a professor of linguistics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.[1] A total of 25 Proto-Austronesian consonants, 4 vowels, and 4 diphthongs were reconstructed. However, Blust acknowledges that some of the reconstructed consonants are still controversial and debated.The symbols below are frequently used in reconstructed Proto-Austronesian words.*C: voiceless alveolar affricate*c: voiceless palatal affricate*q: uvular*z: voiced palatal affricate*D: voiced retroflex stop*j: palatalized voiced velar stop*S: voiceless alveolar fricative*N: palatalized alveolar lateral*r: alveolar flap*R: alveolar or uvular trillProto-Austronesian Consonants (Blust, 2009)LabialAlveolarPalatalRetroflexVelarUvularGlottalUnvoiced stopp /p/t /t/k /k/q /q/Voiced stopb /b/d /d/D /ɖ/g /ɡ/; j /ɡʲ/Nasalm /m/n /n/ñ /ɲ/ŋ /ŋ/FricativeS /s/s /ç/h /h/AffricateC /t͡s/c /c͡ç/,[2] z /ɟ͡ʝ/[3]Laterall /l/N /lʲ/Tap or trillr /ɾ/; R /r/ or /ʀ/[4]Approximantw /w/y /j/*D only appears in final position, *z/*c/*ñ only in initial and medial position, while *j is restricted to medial and final position.The Proto-Austronesian vowels are a, i, u, and ə.Proto-Austronesian Vowels (Blust, 2009)HeightFrontCentralBackClosei /i/u /u/Midə /ə/Opena /a/The diphthongs, which are diachronic sources of individual vowels, are:*-ay*-aw*-uy*-iwWolff's reconstruction[edit]In 2010, John Wolff published his Proto-Austronesian reconstruction in Proto-Austronesian phonology with glossary. Wolff reconstructs a total of 19 consonants, 4 vowels (*i, *u, *a, *e, where *e = /ə/), 4 diphthongs (*ay, *aw, *iw, *uy), and syllabic stress.Proto-Austronesian Consonants (Wolff)LabialAlveolarPalatalVelarGlottalUnvoiced stopp /p/t /t/c /c/k /k/q /q/[5]Voiced stopb /b/d /d/j /ɟ/g /ɡ/ɣ /ɣ/Nasalm /m/n /n/ŋ /ŋ/Fricatives /s/h /h/Laterall /l/ɬ /ɬ/Approximantw /w/y /j/The following table shows how Wolff's Proto-Austronesian phonemic system differs from Blust's system.Wolff's and Blust's PAn phonemesBlust*p*t*C*c*k*q*b*‑D*d‑ *‑d‑*‑d*z‑ *‑z‑*‑j *‑j*g‑*‑g *‑g*R*m*n*N*ñ*ŋ*l*r*s*S*h*w*yWolff*p*trejected*k*q*b*‑d*d‑ *‑d‑*‑j*j‑ *‑j‑*grejected*ɣ*m*n*ɬ*ŋ*lrejected*c*s*h*w*yOther reconstructions[edit]According to Malcolm Ross,[6] the following aspects of Blust's system are uncontroversial: the labials (p b m w); the velars k ŋ; y; R; the vowels; and the above four diphthongs.  There is some disagreement about the postvelars (q ʔ h) and the velars g j, and about whether there are any more diphthongs; however, in these respects, Ross and Blust are in agreement. The major disagreement concerns the system of coronal consonants.  The following discussion is based on Ross (1992).[6]Dempwolff's reconstruction of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian from the 1930s included:Dental t d n lRetroflex ṭ ḍ ḷPalatal t' d' n'Palatal k' g'Dyen (1963), including data from the Formosan languages, expanded Dempwolff's set of coronal consonants: t split into t and Cn split into n and L/Nd' split and renotated as z and Zt' split into s1 and s2ḷ ṭ ḍ n' k' g' h renotated as r T D ñ c j qTsuchida (1976), building on Dyen's system:Further split d into D1 D2 D3 D4. He also believed that Dyen's c (Dempwolff's k') could not be reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian (he also split Dyen's w into w W and q into q Q, which were not accepted by later scholars.)Dahl reduced Tsuchida's consonants into:D1 D2 D3 D4 into d3 d2 d1 d3 (with the new d3 reflecting the combination of the old D1 and D4) and combined Dyen's S X x into a single phoneme S.  He did accept Dyen's c but did not accept his T D. (He also renotated a number of phonemes in ways that were not generally accepted by later scholars.)Blust based his system on a combination of Dyen, Tsuchida and Dahl, and attempted to reduce the total number of phonemes. He accepted Dahl's reduction of Dyen's S X x into S but did not accept either Tsuchida's or Dahl's split of Dyen's d; in addition, he reduced Dyen's s1 s2 to a single phoneme s. While accepting Dyen's c, he was hesitant about T and D (more recently, Blust appears to have accepted D but rejected T, and also rejected Z).Ross likewise attempted to reduce the number of phonemes, but in a different way:He accepts Dahl's d1 d2 d3 and also Z (eventually rejected by Blust).  He notes that the distinction between d1 and d2 d3 is only reconstructable for the Formosan language groups Amis, Proto-Puyuma and Proto-Paiwan, and only Proto-Paiwan has a three-way distinction among d1 d2 d3; contrarily the distinction between Z and d1 is reconstructable only for Proto-Rukai and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, but not any of the previous three groups.  However, he still believes (contra Blust) that the distinction among these phonemes is an inheritance from Proto-Austronesian rather than an innovation in the respective groups.He notes that d1 occurs only morpheme-initially, while r occurs only morpheme-non-initially, and as a result combines the two.He does not accept the phonemes c z ñ in Proto-Austronesian, and asserts that none of them are "readily reconstructable" outside of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian. Furthermore, while he believes that ñ was a general innovation in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, c and z "are reflected differently from PMP [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian] *s and *d only in a fairly limited area of western Indo-Malaysia and appear to be the results of local developments".He also reconstructs the coronals somewhat differently. He believes that C S l d3 were all retroflex (respectively, /tʂ/; /ʂ/ or /ʃ/; /ɭ/ or /ɽ/; /ɖ/), and s and L (Blust's N) were dental /s/ and /l/, as opposed to Blust's reconstruction as dental and palatal, respectively. According to Ross, this is based on their outcomes in the Formosan languages and Javanese; although their outcomes as dental/palatal is geographically more distributed, it occurs only in Malayo-Polynesian, which represent a single clade with respect to the Formosan languages.Sound changes[edit]See also: Formosan languages § Sound changesAs Proto-Austronesian transitioned to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian, the phonemic inventories were continually reduced by merging formerly distinct sounds into one sound. Three mergers were observed in the Proto-Austronesian to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian transition, while nine were observed for the Proto-Oceanic to Proto-Polynesian transition. Thus, Proto-Austronesian has the most elaborate sound system, while Proto-Polynesian has the fewest phonemes. For instance, the Hawaiian language is famous for having only eight consonants, while Māori has only ten consonants. This is a sharp reduction from the 25 consonants of the Proto-Austronesian language that was originally spoken near Taiwan or Kinmen.Blust also observed the following mergers and sound changes between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.[1]Proto-Austronesian andProto-Malayo-Polynesian Sound ChangesProto-AustronesianProto-Malayo-Polynesian*C/t*t*N/n*n*S/h*h*eS[7]*ahHowever, according to Wolff (2010:241), Proto-Malayo-Polynesian's development from Proto-Austronesian only included the following three sound changes.PAn *ɬ > PMP *ñ, l, nPAn *s > PMP *hPAn *h > PMP *ØProto-Oceanic merged even more phonemes. This is why modern-day Polynesian languages have some of the most restricted consonant inventories in the world.[1]Proto-Malayo-Polynesian andProto-Oceanic Sound ChangesProto-Malayo-PolynesianProto-Oceanic*b/p*p*mb/mp*b*c/s/z/j*s*nc/nd/nz/nj*j*g/k*k*ŋg/ŋk*g*d/r*r*e/-aw*o*-i/uy/iw*iUnusual sound changes that occurred within the Austronesian language family are:[1]Proto-Oceanic *t > k in Hawaiian, Samoan, and the Ontong Java language[8]Proto-Polynesian *l and *r > ŋg in RennelleseProto-Oceanic *w and *y > p in Levei KhehekProto-Malayo-Polynesian *w or *b > Sundanese c- or -nc-Syntax[edit]Word order[edit]Proto-Austronesian is a verb-initial language (including VSO and VOS word orders), as most Formosan languages, all Philippine languages, some Bornean languages, all Austronesian dialects of Madagascar, and all Polynesian languages are verb-initial.[1] However, most Austronesian (many of which are Oceanic) languages of Indonesia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Micronesia are SVO, or verb-medial, languages. SOV, or verb-final, word order is considered to be typologically unusual for Austronesian languages, and is only found in various Austronesian languages of New Guinea and to a more limited extent, the Solomon Islands. This is because SOV word order is very common in the non-Austronesian Papuan languages.Voice system[edit]The Austronesian languages of Taiwan, Borneo, Madagascar and the Philippines are also well known for their unusual morphosyntactic alignment, which is known as the Austronesian alignment. This alignment was also present in the Proto-Austronesian language. Unlike Proto-Austronesian, however, Proto-Oceanic syntax does not make use of the focus morphology present in Austronesian-aligned languages such as the Philippine languages. In the Polynesian languages, verbal morphology is relatively simple, while the main unit in a sentence is the phrase rather than the word.Below is a table of John Wolff's Proto-Austronesian voice system from Blust (2009:433). Wolff's "four-voice" system was derived from evidence in various Formosan and Philippine languages.Proto-Austronesian voice systemIndependent (non-past)Independent (past)Future-general actionDependentSubjunctiveActor voice-um--inum-?ø-aDirect passive-en-in-r- -en-a?Local passive-an-in-anr- -an-i-ayInstrumental passivei-i- -in- (?)?-an (?)?However, Ross (2009)[9] notes that what may be the most divergent languages, Tsou, Rukai, and Puyuma, are not addressed by this reconstruction, which therefore cannot claim to be alignment system of the protolanguage of the entire family. He calls the unit to which this reconstruction applies Nuclear Austronesian.Interrogatives and case markers[edit]The following table compares Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian question words.Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian question wordsEnglishProto-AustronesianProto-Malayo-Polynesianwhat*(n)-anu*apawho*(si)-ima*i-saiwhere*i-nu*i nuwhen*ija-n*p-ijanhow*(n)-anu*ku(j)aCurrently, the most complete reconstruction of the Proto-Austronesian case marker system is offered by Malcolm Ross.[1] The reconstructed case markers are as follows:Proto-Austronesian case markersCommon nounsSingularpersonal nounsPluralpersonal nounsNeutral*[y]a, *u*i–Nominative*k-a*k-u–Genitive*n-a, *n-u*n-i*n-i-aAccusative*C-a, *C-u*C-i–Oblique*s-a, *s-u––Locative*d-a––Important Proto-Austronesian grammatical words include the ligature *na and locative *i.[1]Morphology[edit]Morphology and syntax are often hard to separate in the Austronesian languages, particularly the Philippine languages.[1] This is because the morphology of the verbs often affects how the rest of the sentence would be constructed (i.e., syntax).Affixes[edit]Below are some Proto-Austronesian affixes (including prefixes, infixes, and suffixes) reconstructed by Robert Blust. For instance, *pa- was used for non-stative (i.e., dynamic) causatives, while *pa-ka was used for stative causatives (Blust 2009:282). Blust also noted a p/m pairing phenomenon in which many affixes have both p- and m- forms. This system is especially elaborate in the Thao language of Taiwan.[1]Proto-Austronesian AffixesAffixGloss*ka-inchoative (Formosan only), stative, past time, accompanied action/person, abstract noun formative, manner in which an action is carried out, past participle*ma-stative*maka-abilitative/aptative*maki/pakipetitive (petitioning for something)[10]*maŋactor voice*paŋinstrumental voice*maʀ-actor voice*paʀ-instrumental noun*mu-movement[11]*pa(-ka-)causative*paʀi-reciprocal/collective action[12]*qali/kali-sensitive connection with the spirit world[13]*Sa-instrumental voice*Si-instrumental voice*-aninstrumental voice: imperative*Sika-ordinal numeral*ta(ʀ-)sudden, unexpected, or accidental action*-um-actor voice: transitivity, etc.*-in-perfective, nominalizer*-ar-plural*-anlocative voice*-ilocative voice: imperative*-enpatient voice*-apatient voice: imperative*-ayfuture*ka- -anadversative passive, abstract nounsReduplication[edit]CV (consonant + vowel) reduplication is very common among the Austronesian languages. In Proto-Austronesian, Ca-reduplicated (consonant + /a/) numbers were used to count humans, while the non-reduplicated sets were used to count non-human and inanimate objects. CV-reduplication was also used to nominalize verbs in Proto-Austronesian. In Ilocano, CV-reduplication is used to pluralize nouns.Reduplication patterns include (Blust 2009):Full reduplicationFull reduplication plus affixationFull reduplication minus the codaFull reduplication minus the last vowelFull reduplication with vocalic or consonantal change, or bothFull reduplication with consecutive identical syllablesPrefixal foot reduplication/leftward reduplicationSuffixal foot reduplication/rightward reduplicationCVC-reduplicationCV-reduplication (marks durative aspect, collectivity, or intensity in Bunun; future in Tagalog)CV-reduplication plus affixationCa-reduplication (used to derive human-counting numerals and deverbal instrumental nouns in Thao and Puyuma)Extensions of fixed segmentismReduplicative infixesSuffixal syllable reduplicationOther less common patterns are (Blust 2009):Vacuous reduplication (occurs in Paamese)Full reduplication minus the initial (occurs in Anejom of southern Vanuatu)Full reduplication plus an initial glide (occurs in Kosraean)Partial reduplication minus initial glottal stop (occurs in Rennellese)True CV-reduplication (occurs in Pangasinan)Rightward trisyllabic reduplication (occurs in the Manam language)Double reduplication (occurs in Woleaian)Triplication (only in the Thao language)Serial reduplication (only in the Thao language)Vocabulary[edit]Pronouns[edit]See also: Austronesian personal pronounsThe Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian personal pronouns below were reconstructed by Robert Blust.[1]Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian PronounsType of PronounEnglishProto-AustronesianProto-Malayo-Polynesian1s."I"*i-aku*i-aku2s."you/thou"*i-(ka)Su*i-kahu3s."he/she/it"*si-ia*si-ia1p.

The cardinal directions of north, south, east, and west developed among the Austronesian languages only after contact with the Europeans. For the land-sea axis, upstream/uphill and inland, as well as downstream/downhill and seaward, are synonym pairs. This has been proposed as evidence that Proto-Austronesians used to live on a mainland, since the sea would be visible from all angles on small islands.[1]*daya: inland (also upstream/uphill)*lahud: seaward (also downstream/downhill)*SabaRat: west monsoon*timuR: east monsoon*qamiS: north windIn Kavalan, Amis, and Tagalog, the reflexes of *timuR mean "south" or "south wind," while in the languages of the southern Philippines and Indonesia it means "east" or "east wind."In Ilocano, dáya and láud respectively mean "east" and "west," while in Puyuma, ɖaya and ɭauɖ respectively mean "west" and "east."[17] This is because the Ilocano homeland is the west coast of northern Luzon, while the Puyuma homeland is located on the eastern coast of southern Taiwan. Among the Bontok, Kankanaey, and Ifugaw languages of northern Luzon, the reflexes of *daya mean "sky" due to the fact that they already live in some of the highest elevations in the Philippines (Blust 2009:301).Also, the Malay reflex of *lahud is laut, which means "sea", used as directions timur laut (means "northeast", timur = "east") and barat laut (means "northwest", barat = "west"). Meanwhile, *daya only performs in barat daya, which means "southwest".On the other hand, the Javanese reflex of *lahud, lor, means "north" since the Java Sea is located to the north of the island of Java.Numerals[edit]Below are reconstructed Proto-Austronesian, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian numbers from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database.[18]NumeralsNumberProto-AustronesianProto-Malayo-PolynesianProto-OceanicProto-Polynesianone*esa, *isa*esa, *isa*sa-kai, *ta-sa, *tai, *kai*tahatwo*duSa*duha*rua*ruathree*telu*telu*tolu*tolufour*Sepat*epat*pat, *pati, *pani*faafive*lima*lima*lima*limaThe Proto-Austronesian language had different sets of numerals for non-humans ("set A") and humans ("set B") (Blust 2009:279). Cardinal numerals for counting humans are derived from the non-human numerals through Ca-reduplication. This bipartite numeral system is found in Thao, Puyuma, Yami, Chamorro, and various other languages (however, Paiwan uses ma- and manə- to derive human numerals).
