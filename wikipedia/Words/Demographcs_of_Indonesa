Demographics of IndonesiaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to search  Indonesian students during school excursion to a museum; Indonesia currently possesses a relatively young population.The population of Indonesia according to the 2010 national census was 237.64 million,[1] and it was estimated to reach 255.4 million in 2015.[2] 58% live on the island of Java,[1] the world's most populous island.[3]Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[4] for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States.[5] Some say family planning should be revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country, but this aim has been criticized by religious groups who believe that family planning goes against religious teachings.[6]Indonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. Indonesia's median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[7]Indonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian (a form of Malay and the official national language) is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.Contents1 Population1.1 Population by province1.2 Largest cities1.3 Age structure2 Vital statistics2.1 UN estimates[13]2.2 Fertility and Births (Demographic and Health Surveys)2.3 Fertility rate and aging population (by province)2.4 Life expectancy3 Ethnic groups4 Religions5 Languages6 Literacy7 CIA World Factbook demographic statistics8 See also9 References10 External linksPopulation[edit]  Provinces of Indonesia by population density per square kilometers in 2015   10,001 above   1,001 to 10,000   101 to 1,000   11 to 100   1 to 10Historical population of IndonesiaYearPop.±% p.a.1930 60,727,233—    1955 77,473,268+0.98%1961 97,085,348+3.83%1971 119,208,229+2.07%1976 141,862,419+3.54%1980 147,490,298+0.98%1990 179,378,946+1.98%2000 206,264,595+1.41%2010 237,641,326+1.43%Source: Statistics Indonesia,[8] Wertheim (1959) [9], Geografi dan Kependudukan (1976) [10], Widjojo Nitisastro (2006)[11]Population by province[edit]ProvincePopulation (2010 Census)Urban population (%)TFRAceh4,486,57023.62.79North Sumatra12,985,07542.43.01West Sumatra4,845,99829.02.91Riau5,543,03143.72.82Jambi3,088,61828.32.51South Sumatra7,446,40134.42.56Bengkulu1,713,39329.42.51Lampung7,596,11521.02.45Bangka Belitung1,223,04843.02.54Riau Islands1,685,69867.42.38Banten10,644,03052.22.35Jakarta9,588,198100.01.82West Java43,021,82650.32.43Central Java32,380,68740.42.20Yogyakarta3,452,39057.71.94East Java37,476,01140.92.00Bali3,891,42849.82.13West Nusa Tenggara4,496,85534.82.59East Nusa Tenggara4,679,31615.93.82West Kalimantan4,393,23925.12.64Central Kalimantan2,202,59927.52.56South Kalimantan3,626,11936.32.35East Kalimantan3,550,58657.62.61North Sulawesi2,265,93737.02.43Gorontalo1,038,58525.52.76Central Sulawesi2,633,42019.72.94South Sulawesi8,032,55129.42.55Southeast Sulawesi2,230,56920.83.20West Sulawesi1,158,336--3.33Maluku1,531,40225.93.56North Maluku1,035,47829.53.35Papua2,851,99922.22.87West Papua760,855--3.18Indonesia237,641,3262.41Source: Population Census 2010[1][1]Largest cities[edit] vte Largest cities in Indonesia2015 inter-census surveyRankNameProvince Pop.RankNameProvince Pop.JakartaSurabaya1JakartaJakarta10,154,13411MakassarSouth Sulawesi1,447,677BekasiBandung2SurabayaEast Java2,847,48012BatamRiau Islands1,184,9783BekasiWest Java2,708,72113BogorWest Java1,046,5794BandungWest Java2,480,61514PekanbaruRiau1,035,8345MedanNorth Sumatra2,209,13915Bandar LampungLampung977,6866DepokWest Java2,099,98916PadangWest Sumatra901,3057TangerangBanten2,043,21317DenpasarBali879,0988SemarangCentral Java1,698,77718MalangEast Java850,9049PalembangSouth Sumatra1,578,58219SamarindaEast Kalimantan811,31410South TangerangBanten1,538,97020BanjarmasinSouth Kalimantan674,739Age structure[edit]Age structure in Indonesia (2010)[12]  Minor: 0-14 years (27.3%)  Workforce: 15-64 years (66.5%)  Retiree: 65 years and over (6.2%)Indonesia demographic composition has a relatively young population.
