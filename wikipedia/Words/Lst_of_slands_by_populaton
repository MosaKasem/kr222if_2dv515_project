List of islands by populationFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchThis is a list of islands in the world ordered by population, which includes all islands with population greater than 100,000. For comparison, continental landmasses are also shown, in italics. The population of the world's islands is over 730 million, approximately 11% of the world's total population.  Of those, only Java and Honshu have populations over 1% of the global population.Contents1 Islands ordered by population1.1 Population over 10 million1.2 Population 1,000,000 to 10,000,0001.3 Population 500,000 to 1,000,0001.4 Population 100,000 to 500,0001.4.1 Population over 100,000 but exact population is unknown2 Artificial islands or not usually regarded as islands3 Future islands4 See also5 References6 External linksIslands ordered by population[edit]Due to the complicated nature of determining exactly what constitutes a geographic island, versus an administrative region, please see comments for what is included in figures, as some islands include nearby ones.  However, this practice is not advised.
