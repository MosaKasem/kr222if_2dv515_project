At the end of the 15th century, an Arab named Kyai Pandan Arang founded a village and an Islamic school in this fishing village. On 2 May 1547, Sultan Hadiwijaya of Pajang Kyai declared Pandan Arang the first bupati (mayor) of Semarang, thus creating Semarang administratively and politically.In 1678, Sunan Amangkurat II promised to give control of Semarang to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a part of a debt payment. In 1682, the Semarang state was founded by the Dutch colonial power. On 5 October 1705 after years of occupations, Semarang officially became a VOC city when Susuhunan Pakubuwono I made a deal to give extensive trade rights to the VOC in exchange of wiping out Mataram's debt. The VOC, and later, the Dutch East Indies government, established tobacco plantations in the region and built roads and railroads, making Semarang an important colonial trading centre.[citation needed]The historic presence of a large Indo (Eurasian) community in the area of Semarang is also reflected by the fact a creole mix language called Javindo existed there.[4]Classical Indische Town (1678–1870)[edit]  The early VOC settlement of Semarang with its prominent pentagonal fortress.Semarang was handed by the Sultan of Mataram to the Dutch East Indies in 1678. The city was pictured as a small settlement with a pious Muslim area called Kauman, a Chinese quarter, and a Dutch fortress. The fortress has a pentagonal form with only one gate in the south and five monitoring towers to protect the Dutch settlement from rebellion actions, segregating the spaces between Dutch settlement and other areas.[5] In fact, the city of Semarang was only referred to the Dutch quarter while the other ethnic settlement were considered as villages outside the city boundary. The city, known as de Europeesche Buurt, was built in classical European style with church located in the centre, wide boulevards, streets and villas.[6]  According to Purwanto (2005),[7] the urban and architectural form of this settlement is very similar to the design principles applied in many Dutch cities, which begun to concern on the urban beautification.Due to the long and costly Java War, there was not much funding from the Dutch East Indies government, which affected Semarang's development. The majority of land was used for rice fields and the only small improvement was the development of a surrounding fortress. Although less developed, Semarang has a fairly arranged city system, in which urban activities were concentrated along the river and the settlement was linked to a market where different ethnic groups met to trade. The existence of the market, in the later years, become a primary element and a generator of urban economic growth.[8]An important influence on urban growth was the Great Mail Road project in the 1847, which connected all the cities in the northern coast of Central and East Java and positioned Semarang as the trade centre of agricultural production.[9] The project was soon followed by the development of the Netherlands Indies railway and the connecting roads into the inner city of Semarang at the end of 19th century.[8] Colombijn (2002)[9] marked the development as the shift of urban functions, from the former river orientation to all services facing the roads.The modern city (1870–1922)[edit]  Coat of Arms of Semarang during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1827.Improved communication, the result of the Mail and Railway projects, brought an economic boom to the city in the 1870s. There were hospitals, churches, hotels, and large houses built along new main roads; Bojongscheweg, Pontjolscheweg, and Mataram street, densified population in the ethnic settlements and created the urban kampong (village).[6]Urban growth densified the urban kampong, reaching 1,000 inhabitants per hectare and degrading the quality of living conditions.[10] In the early 20th century, mortality rate were high due to the overcrowding and lack of hygiene that triggered cholera and tuberculosis outbreaks.[11] Cobban (1993)[10] noted the ethical movement of kampongverbetering led by Henry Tillema in 1913 and the concern of the Advisor for Decentralisation for kampong improvement through the betterment of public toilets, drainage, and the planning of public housing.In 1917, a healthy housing project was implemented in the Southern part of Semarang called Candi Baru. Thomas Karsten, the advisor for city planning, transformed the concept of ethnic segregation that divided previous urban settlements into a new housing district plan based on economic classes. Although practically the three ethnic groups were also divided into three economic classes where the Dutch and rich Chinese occupied the largest lots in the housing district,[6] Karsten had effectively emerged the developed district by integrating the road network, introducing newly improved public washing and bathing, squares and sporting facilities that could be used communally.[12] Following the Candi Baru, there were three other housing plans between 1916–1919 to accommodate a 55% population increase in Semarang; 45,000 Javanese, 8500 Chinese and 7000 Europeans. Karsten marked a new approach to town planning with emphasis on the aesthetic, practical and social requirements, articulated not in terms of race but economic zones.[12]Driven by economic growth and spatial city planning, the city had doubled in size and expanded to the south by the 1920s, creating a nucleus of a metropolis where multi-ethnic groups lived and traded in the city. The villages in the suburbs such as Jomblang and Jatingaleh steadily became the satellite towns of Semarang, more populated with a bigger market area. Before the invasion of Japan in 1942, Semarang had already become the capital of Central Java Province, as the result of trade and industrial success and spatial planning.[6]NIS company head office (Gedung Lawang Sewu), Semarang, Dutch East Indies.A Chinese house in Semarang at the turn of the 20th century.Aerial picture of Old Semarang area in 1920s.Old 0-6-0 locomotive next to the Lawang Sewu building.Japanese occupation and early independence[edit]The Japanese military occupied the city, along with the rest of Java, in 1942, during the Pacific War of World War II. During that time, Semarang was headed by a military governor called a Shiko, and two vice governors known as Fuku Shiko. One of the vice governors was appointed from Japan, and the other was chosen from the local population.[citation needed]After Indonesian independence in 1945, Semarang became the site of a battle between Indonesian and Japanese soldiers in October 1945.[13] It also became the capital of Central Java province.[citation needed]Administration[edit]Semarang city administration is headed by mayor, with a legislative assembly. Both mayor and members of legislative assembly are elected by direct vote. Semarang City Government had implemented the smart city concept since 2013.[14][15]  Juridically, Semarang City is a municipality (second level area) consisting of 16 sub-districts (kecamatan), which again divided into 177 administartive villages (Kelurahan). The widest sub-district area in Semarang City is Mijen Sub-District which has an area of 57.55 square kilometers. The smallest sub-district area is South Semarang District, which is only 5.93 square kilometers. The city of Semarang is divided into five urban areas, including: Central Semarang, East Semarang, West Semarang, South Semarang, and North Semarang.Following are the sub-districts and administrative villages of semarang,Sub-districtAdminitrative villagesBanyumanikPudakpayung, Gedawang, Jabungan, Padangsari, Banyumanik, Srondol Wetan, Pedalangan, Banyumanik, Semarang, Sumurboto, Banyumanik, Semarang, Srondol Kulon, Banyumanik, Semarang, Tinjomoyo, NgesrepCandisariCandi, Jatingaleh, Jomblang, Kaliwiru, Karanganyargunung, Tegalsari, WonotingalGajahmungkurBendanduwur, Bendanngisor, Bendungan, Gajahmungkur, Karangrejo, Lempongsari, Petompon, SampanganGayamsariGayamsari, Kaligawe, Pandean Lamper, Sambirejo, Sawah Besar, Siwalan, TambakrejoGenukBangetayu Kulon, Bangetayu Wetan, Banjardowo, Gebangsari, Genuksari, Karangroto, Kudu, Muktiharjo Lor, Penggaron Lor, Sembungharjo, Terboyo Kulon, Terboyo Wetan, TrimulyoGunungpatiCepoko, Gunungpati, Jatirejo, Kalisegoro, Kandri, Mangunsari, Ngijo, Nongkosawit, Pakintelan, Patemon, Plalangan, Pongangan, Sadeng, Sekaran, Sukorejo, SumurejoMijenCangkiran, Bubakan, Jatibarang, Jatisari, Karangmalang, Kedungpane, Mijen, Ngadirgo, Pesantren, Polaman, Purwosari, Tambangan, Wonolopo, Wonoplumbon,NgaliyanBambankerep, Beringin, Gondoriyo, Kalipancur, Ngaliyan, Podorejo, Purwoyoso, Tambak Aji, WonosariPedurunganGemah, Kalicari, Muktiharjo Kidul, Palebon, Pedurungan Kidul, Pedurungan Lor, Pedurungan Tengah, Penggaron Kidul, Plamongan Sari, Tlogomulyo, Tlogosari Kulon, Tlogosari Wetan,Semarang BaratBojongsalaman, Bongsari, Cabean, Gisikdrono, Kalibanteng Kidul, Kalibanteng Kulon, Karangayu, Kembangarum, Krapyak, Krobokan, Manyaran, Ngemplaksimongan, Salamanmloyo, Tambakharjo, Tawangmas, TawangsariSemarang SelatanBarusari, Bulustalan, Lamper Kidul, Lamper Lor, Lamper Tengah, Mugassari, Peterongan, Pleburan, Randusari, WonodriSemarang TengahBangunharjo, Brumbungan, Gabahan, Jagalan, Karangkidul, Kauman, Kembangsari, Kranggan, Miroto, Pandansari, Pekunden, Pendrikan Kidul, Pendrikan Lor, Purwodinatan, SekayuSemarang TimurBugangan, Karangtempel, Karangturi, Kebonagung, Kemijen, Mlatibaru, Mlatiharjo, Rejomulyo, Rejosari, Sarirejo, BandarharjoSemarang UtaraBulu Lor, Dadapsari, Kuningan, Panggung Kidul, Panggung Lor, Plombokan, Purwosari, TanjungmasTembalangBulusan, Jangli, Kedungmundu, Kramas, Mangunharjo, Meteseh, Rowosari, Sambiroto, Sendangguwo, Sendangmulyo, Tandang, TembalangTuguJerakan, Karanganyar, Mangkang Kulon, Mangkang Wetan, Mangunharjo, Randu Garut, TugurejoGeography[edit]Semarang is located on the northern coast of Java. The city of Semarang is one of the important cities located on the north coast of Java and as the main hub connecting Jakarta and  Surabaya, and cities in the southern interior of Java Surakarta and Yogyakarta. Semarang City has a height of 2 meters below sea level up to 340 meters above sea level with a slope of 0% - 45%. Semarang City is a city that has a unique topographic condition in the form of a narrow lowland area and hilly areas extending from the west side to the east side of Semarang City. The city is located about 558 km east of Jakarta and 312 km west of Surabaya Lowland areas in Semarang City are very narrow. The lowland area in the western region of Semarang City only has a width of 4 kilometers from the coastline, while in the eastern region of the City of Semarang the low-lying area is widening to 11 kilometers from the coastline. This lowland area is a flood plain from the large rivers that flow in Semarang City, such as Kali Garang (West Flood Canal), Pengkol River, and Bringin River. This low-lying area stretches on the northern side of Semarang City and almost covers 40% of the total area of Semarang City. This lowland area is known as the lower town ( Semarang Ngisor ), as well as the center of the city's economic activity. Under these conditions, the lower city area is often hit by annual flooding and its peak during the rainy season. A number of regions, especially North Semarang, this flood is sometimes also caused by overflowing sea tides (tidal floods). The hilly area in Semarang City stretches on the south side. These hills are part of a series of northern Java mountain ranges that stretch from Banten to East Java. The hilly area in the city of Semarang is known as the upper city ( Semarang Dhuwur ). This hilly region is also the upstream area of the big rivers that flow in the city of Semarang. The upper city area is also part of the Ungaran volcano, which is located on the southern side of Semarang City.Climate[edit]Semarang features a tropical rainforest climate that borders on a tropical monsoon climate (Am). The city features distinctly wetter and drier months, with June through August being the driest months. However, in none of these months does average precipitation fall below 60 mm, hence the tropical rainforest categorization. Semarang on average sees approximately 2800 mm of rain annually. Average temperatures in the city are relatively consistent, hovering around 28 degrees Celsius. Semarang is also known for having Indonesia's hottest maximum temperature record; reaching 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on October 14, 2014 [16]Climate data for SemarangMonthJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecYearAverage high °C (°F)29(85)29(85)30(86)31(88)32(89)32(89)32(89)32(89)32(90)32(90)31(88)30(86)31(88)Average low °C (°F)25(77)25(77)25(77)26(78)26(78)25(77)24(76)24(76)25(77)26(78)26(78)25(77)25(77)Average precipitation mm (inches)430(16.9)360(14.2)320(12.6)230(9.1)160(6.3)80(3.1)80(3.1)60(2.4)100(3.9)160(6.3)220(8.7)330(13.0)2,780(109.4)Source: Weatherbase [17]Semarang River and flood control[edit]Like Singapore River, Semarang is constructing Semarang River at Banjir Kanal Barat (Garang River) near Karangayu Bridge. In the middle of July 2011, gardens in river banks and some traditional boats are available to use. The project will be finished in 2013 with river gardens, trotoars, garden lighting, water activities, art sites, sport sites and balconies and stairs for sightseeing.[18]In August 2011, a 421 metres (1,381 ft) tunnel dodger at Kreo river has been finished and Jatibarang Dam construction can begin, with completion targeted for July 2013. The dam is planned to ease 230 cubic metres (8,100 cu ft) per second of flood water and will generate 1.5 Megawatts of  electricity, provide a drinking water resource and a boost to tourism.[19]Demography[edit]The largest ethnicity of Semarang includes the Javanese, followed by minorities of Chinese, Indian, Arabic, and others (including local ethnicities such as Sundanese, Batak, Madura, etc.).
