The islands of Kambing, Giliraja, Genteng, and Ketapang lie in the Strait. The Suramadu Bridge, the longest in Indonesia, spans the strait between Surabaya on Java and Bangkalan on Madura.[1]In some old Western and old Indonesian sources, the strait commonly appears as Surabaya Strait (Indonesian: Selat Surabaya), but this name is not accepted in the official cartography.Contents1 Geography2 Culture and economic importance3 References4 Further readingGeography[edit]The Madura Strait is located in the east of the province of northern East Java, precisely in the southwest, north, and east of the city of Surabaya; east of Sidoarjo Regency; west and south of the island of Madura; and north of the Pasuruan, Probolinggo, and Situbondo area. In this strait there are also small islands, including Kambing Island, Giliraja Island, and Genteng Island near the island of Madura, and Ketapang Island in the coastal waters of Probolinggo Regency. As a maritime waterway, the Madura strait connects various seas along the Java sea, Bali sea, and Bali strait.A remarkable story about the origin of the Madura Strait is contained in the Javanese historical poem of Nagarakertagama, dating from circa 1365. According to the author of the poem, the strait between Java and Madura, which originally were supposedly a single island, was formed in 202 as a result of a powerful earthquake. This version does not have any scientific confirmation.[2]Culture and economic importance[edit]  Activities in Tanjung PerakThe Madura Strait coastal community, like other coastal communities also has coastal culture, one of its cultures, is when every specific date, based on the Islamic calendar, is held a tradition called Pethik Laut, which is in the form of releasing offerings carried together and released to middle of the beach.
