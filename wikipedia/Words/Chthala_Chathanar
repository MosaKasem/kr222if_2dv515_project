A total of 11 verses of the Sangam literature have been attributed to Satthanar, including verse 10 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.[1]Contents1 Etymology2 Biography3 Contribution to the Sangam literature4 See also5 References6 Further readingEtymology[edit]Pronounced Sa-tha-naar, the name is derived from (Tamil: சாத்து, sāttu) meaning Buddhist monk.[2] Applying this principle to the name Maturai Kulavāṇikan Cāttan, the author of Manimekalai, we see that the two appellations Maturai and Kulavanikan were prefixed to his name in order to distinguish him from another poet of Maturai with the same name and from a third who lived elsewhere. Several examples could be cited of this system of nomenclature which prevailed during the early days.[3]Biography[edit]Satthanar hailed from a place known as Seerthandalai, later came to be known as Seethalai.[1] He was a grain merchant at Madurai and hence came to be called "Koolavanigan". He was a contemporary of Cheran Senguttuvan and was believed to have practiced Buddhism. He has sung in praise of the Pandyan king Chittira Maadatthu Thunjiya Nanmaran in the Sangam work of Purananuru.[4]Vaiyapuri Pillai sees him along with Ilango Adigal as developing two divergent strands of the Chilampu legend that forms the basis for both Cilapatikaram and Manimekalai.[5]He is seen as an expert in both orthodox and heterodox systems of Indian philosophy and as an advocate of Buddhist philosophy.[6]It is seen that Maṇimekhalai was written after the Tirukkural was composed, because there are two verses from the Tirukkural quoted in Manimekalai.[7][8]Contribution to the Sangam literature[edit]Satthanar composed the Manimekalai and has authored 11 Sangam verses, including 3 in Natrinai, 5 in Agananuru, and 1 each in Kurunthogai, Purananuru, and Tiruvalluva Maalai.[4]See also[edit]Tamils portalIndia portalLiterature portalPoetry portalSangam literatureList of Sangam poetsTiruvalluva MaalaiReferences[edit]^ a b Vedanayagam, Rama (2017).
