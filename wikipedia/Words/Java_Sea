It lies between the Indonesian islands of Borneo to the north, Java to the south, Sumatra to the west, and Sulawesi to the east. Karimata Strait to its northwest links it to the South China Sea.Contents1 Geography1.1 Extent2 History3 Economic activities4 References5 Further readingGeography[edit]The Java Sea covers the southern section of the 1,790,000 km2 (690,000 sq mi) Sunda Shelf.A shallow sea, it has a mean depth of 46 m (151 ft). It measures about 1,600 km (990 mi) east-west by 380 km (240 mi) north-south[1] and occupies a total surface area of 320,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi).It formed as sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age.[2] The almost uniform flatness of the sea bottom and the presence of drainage channels (traceable to the mouths of island rivers) indicate that the Sunda Shelf was once a stable, dry, low-relief land area (peneplain) above which were left standing a few monadnocks (granite hills that by virtue of their resistance to erosion form the present islands).Extent[edit]The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Java Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:[3]On the North. By the Southern limit of the South China Sea [Lucipara Point (3°14′S 106°05′E﻿ / ﻿3.233°S 106.083°E﻿ / -3.233; 106.083) thence to Tanjong Nanka, the Southwest extremity of Bangka Island, through this island to Tanjong Berikat the Eastern point (2°34′S 106°51′E﻿ / ﻿2.567°S 106.850°E﻿ / -2.567; 106.850), on to Tanjong Djemang (2°36′S 107°37′E﻿ / ﻿2.600°S 107.617°E﻿ / -2.600; 107.617) in Billiton, along the North coast of this island to Tanjong Boeroeng Mandi (2°46′S 108°16′E﻿ / ﻿2.767°S 108.267°E﻿ / -2.767; 108.267) and thence a line to Tanjong Sambar (3°00′S 110°19′E﻿ / ﻿3.000°S 110.317°E﻿ / -3.000; 110.317) the Southwest extreme of Borneo], the South coast of Borneo and the Southern limit of Makassar Strait [By a line from the Southwestern extreme of Celebes (5°37′S 119°27′E﻿ / ﻿5.617°S 119.450°E﻿ / -5.617; 119.450), through the Southern point of Tana Keke, to the Southern extreme of Laoet (4°06′S 116°06′E﻿ / ﻿4.100°S 116.100°E﻿ / -4.100; 116.100) thence up the West coast of that island to Tanjong Kiwi and thence across to Tanjong Petang, Borneo (3°37′S 115°57′E﻿ / ﻿3.617°S 115.950°E﻿ / -3.617; 115.950) at the Southern end of Laoet Strait].On the East.

The naval forces of the Netherlands, Britain, Australia, and the United States were nearly destroyed trying to defend Java from Japanese attack.[4][5]On 28 December 2014, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the Java Sea while en route to Singapore from Surabaya, Indonesia. All 162 passengers and crew were killed.[6]On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta heading towards Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang. All 189 passengers and crew on board are presumed dead.[7]Economic activities[edit]The southern section of the seafloor has long been recognized as geologically similar to northern Java, where oil fields occur and extend under the sea. Prospects are also favourable for oil fields in the waters off southeast Kalimantan. As the site of successful exploration for petroleum and natural gas, the Java Sea has become the basis of Indonesia's export program.Fishing is an important economic activity in the Java Sea. Over 3,000 species of marine life are found in the area. A number of national parks exist in the area such as Karimunjawa. The Thousand Islands are located north of the national capital Jakarta, and are the city's only regency.The area around the Java Sea is also a popular tourist destination. Scuba diving offers a chance to explore and photograph underwater caverns, wrecks, coral, sponges, and other marine life.[8]References[edit]^ GoogleEarth^ "Pleistocene Sea Level Maps".
