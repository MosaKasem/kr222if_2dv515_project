Ruled by the Yogyakarta Sultanate, the region is the only officially recognised monarchy within the government of Indonesia. The city of Yogyakarta is the capital and the economic center of the region.The Yogyakarta Sultanate has been established since 1755 and provided an unwavering support for Indonesia's independence during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). As a first-level division in Indonesia, Yogyakarta is governed by Sultan Hamengkubuwono as the governor and Prince Paku Alam as the vice governor. With a land area of 3,185.8 km², it is the second-smallest province of Indonesia after Jakarta.[6]Contents1 History2 Geography2.1 Geo-heritage sites3 Administrative divisions4 Demographics4.1 Religion5 Transport6 Education7 Sister relationships8 See also9 Notes10 References11 External linksHistory[edit]Further information: Yogyakarta Sultanate and List of Governors of Yogyakarta  Praja Cihna (Javanese: ꦥꦿꦗꦕꦶꦃꦤ), coat of arms or crest of the Yogyakarta Sultanate that is upheld by Mataram society. The crest contains the Javanese script ꦲꦨ꧀ꦮ, a royal monogram of Hamengkubuwono.In Javanese it is pronounced [joɡjaˈkartɔ], and named after the city of Ayodhya in Javanese-Hindu mythology.[7] The Dutch name of the Special Region is Djokjakarta.The Sultanate has existed in various forms through prehistory, and survived through the rule of the Dutch and the 1942 invasion of the Dutch East Indies by the Japanese Empire. In August 1945 Indonesia's first president, Sukarno proclaimed the independence of the Indonesian Republic, and by September of that year, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and duke Sri Paku Alam VIII had sent letters to Sukarno expressing their support for the newly-born nation of Indonesia, in which they acknowledged the Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of the Indonesian Republic. The Sunanate of Surakarta did the same, and both of the Javanese kingdoms were awarded special status as special regions within Indonesian Republic. However, due to a leftist anti-royalist uprising in Surakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta lost its special administrative status in 1946 and was absorbed into the province of Central Java.Yogyakarta's overwhelming support and the Sultan's patriotism were essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). The city of Yogyakarta became the capital of the Indonesian Republic from January 1946 to December 1948 after the fall of Jakarta to the Dutch. Later, the Dutch also invaded Yogyakarta causing the Indonesian Republic's capital to be transferred again to Bukittinggi in West Sumatra on 19 December 1948. In return for Yogyakarta's support, the declaration of Special Authority over Yogyakarta was granted in full in 1950 and Yogyakarta was given the status as a Special Administrative Region, making Yogyakarta the only region headed by a monarchy in Indonesia.The Special Region was struck by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake on 27 May 2006, killing 5,782 people, injuring approximately 36,000 and leaving 600,000 people homeless.[8] The region of Bantul suffered the most damage and deaths.Geography[edit]The Special Region is located near the southern coast of Java, surrounded on three sides by the province of Central Java, and with the Indian Ocean on the south side. The population at the 2010 Census was 3,452,390 people, but according to the latest official estimate (January 2014) has risen to 3,594,290. It has an area of 3,133.15 km2, making it the second-smallest area of the provinces in Indonesia, after the Jakarta Capital Region. Along with surrounding areas in Central Java, it has some of the highest population densities of Java.Mount Merapi is located to the immediate north of the city of Yogyakarta and Sleman Regency.  It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548.  It last erupted in October–November 2010, killing and injuring many people and temporarily displacing approximately 100,000 residents.[9][10]Geo-heritage sites[edit]Indonesia has numbers of geo-heritage sites in Yogyakarta Special Region. It has been declared by Geological Agency of the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry. The sites consists of 9 sites:Eosen limestone in Gamping (Sleman regency), pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman), pre-historic volcanic sediment in Candi Ijo, Prambanan (Sleman), sand dunes in Parangtritis Beach (Bantul regency), Kiskendo cave and former manganese mining site in Kleripan (Kulonprogo regency), the prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul regency), Wediombo-Siung beaches (Gunungkidul) and Bioturbasi site in Kalingalang (Gunungkidul). The most unusual one is pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman) which is a big, rough black rock lays on the bank of narrow Dengkeng River. The prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul regency) has already been developed as a tourist destination.Administrative divisions[edit]The Special Region of Yogyakarta (provincial level) is subdivided into four regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota):NameCapitalArea (km²)Population  2000 CensusPopulation  2005 estimatePopulation  2010 CensusPopulation  2014 estimateHDI[11]2018 EstimatesYogyakarta CityYogyakarta City32.50396,700433,539388,627404,0030.861 (Very High)Bantul RegencyBantul508.13781,000859,968911,503947,5680.794 (High)Gunung Kidul RegencyWonosari1,431.42670,400681,554675,382702,1040.692 (Medium)Kulon Progo RegencyWates586.28371,000373,757388,869404,1550.737 (High)Sleman RegencySleman574.82901,400988,2771,093,1101,136,3600.834 (Very High)Totals3,133.153,121,0453,337,0953,457,4913,594,2900.795 (High)Located within the Special Region of Yogyakarta, the city of Yogyakarta is known as a center of classical Javanese fine art and culture such as batik, ballet, drama, music, poetry and puppet shows.
