The city has a population of over 3 million within its city limits and over 10 million in the Surabaya metropolitan area, making it the second-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia.[2] Located on northeastern Java on the Madura Strait, it is one of the earliest port cities in Southeast Asia. According to the National Development Planning Agency, Surabaya is one of the four main central cities of Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Medan, and Makassar.[6][7]The city was settled in 10th century by Kingdom of Janggala, one of the two Javanese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated his throne in favour of his two sons. In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to be a duchy, a major political and military power as well as a port in eastern Java, probably under Majapahit empire.[8] At that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port, owing to its location on the River Brantas delta and on the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea. During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate, and only submitted to its rule in 1530.[9][10] Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546.[11][12]In the 18th and 19th centuries, Surabaya was the largest city in the Dutch East Indies, larger than Batavia (present day Jakarta) and the centre of trading in the nation, which was then a competitor of Shanghai and Hong Kong.[13] The city is known as Kota Pahlawan  (city of heroes) due to the importance of the Battle of Surabaya in galvanizing Indonesian and international support for Indonesian independence during the Indonesian National Revolution. Today the city remains one of the important entertainment, financial, industrial, transportational, and commercial hubs of the Indonesian archipelago,[14] arguably second only to Jakarta, and the Port of Tanjung Perak is Indonesia's second-busiest seaport located on northern Surabaya. In 2016, Surabaya received seven consecutive times Adipura Kencana Award from 2010 as number one among 20 cities in Indonesia.[15] Surabaya awarded by a Singaporean Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize as city's special mention.[16]Contents1 History1.1 Etymology1.2 Early history1.3 Precolonial era1.4 Colonial era1.5 Independence era2 Geography2.1 Topography2.2 Cityscapes2.3 Climate2.4 Urban forest and parks3 Government4 Demographics4.1 Ethnicity4.2 Language4.3 Religion4.4 Culture5 Economy5.1 Business5.2 Business districts5.3 Retail6 Infrastructure6.1 Architecture6.2 Important landmarks6.3 Military establishment6.4 Transportation6.4.1 Airport6.4.2 Seaport6.4.3 Train6.4.4 Bus6.4.5 Public transport6.5 Suramadu Bridge7 Sports8 Education8.1 Universities and post-secondary institutions8.2 Primary and secondary schools9 Cuisine10 Notable people11 International relations11.1 Diplomatic Missions11.1.1 General Consulates11.1.2 Consulates11.1.3 Other diplomatics11.2 Twin towns (sister cities)12 Gallery13 See also14 Notes15 References16 Further reading17 External linksHistory[edit]Further information: Timeline of SurabayaEtymology[edit]  Fighting shark and crocodile, the emblem of Surabaya since colonial times, derived from local folk etymologySurabaya alludes to a prophecy of Jayabaya, a 12th-century psychic king of Kediri Kingdom, foreseeing a fight between a giant white shark and a giant white crocodile taking place in the area,[17] which is sometimes interpreted as foretelling the Mongol invasion of Java, a major conflict between the forces of Kublai Khan, Mongol ruler of China, and those of Raden Wijaya's Majapahit on 31 May 1293,[18][19] which is now considered the date of the city's founding.[20] The two animals are now used as the city's symbol, with the two facing and circling each other, as depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the city zoo.[21]Alternate derivations proliferate: from the Javanese sura ing baya, meaning "bravely facing danger";[19] or from the use of surya to refer to the sun. Some people consider Jayabaya's prophecy as being about the great war between native Surabayan people and foreign invaders at the start of the war of independence in 1945. Another story tells of two heroes who fought each other to be the king of the city. The two heroes were named Sura and Baya. These folk etymologies, though embraced enthusiastically by its people and city leaders, are unverifiable.[22]  Dutch residenthuis (resident house) along the water in Surabaya  Red Bridge area from the air in the 1920sEarly history[edit]  Map of Surabaya from an 1897 English travel guideThe Kingdom of Janggala was one of the two Javanese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated his throne in favour of his two sons. The earliest historical record of Surabaya was in the 1225 book Zhu fan zhi written by Zhao Rugua, in which it was called Jung-ya-lu.[23] The name Janggala was probably originated from the name "Hujung Galuh" (Old Javanese lit: "Cape Diamond" or "Cape Gemstone"), or "Jung-ya-lu" according to Chinese source. Hujung Galuh was located on the estuarine of Brantas River and today is the part of modern Surabaya city and Sidoarjo Regency.[24] The earliest historical record of Surabaya was in the 1225 book Zhu fan zhi written by Zhao Rugua, in which it was called Jung-ya-lu.[23] The name Janggala was probably originated from the name "Hujung Galuh" (Old Javanese lit: "Cape Diamond" or "Cape Gemstone"), or "Jung-ya-lu" according to Chinese source. Hujung Galuh was located on the estuarine of Mas River, one of tributaries of Brantas River and today is the part of modern Surabaya and Sidoarjo.[25]By the 14th to 15th centuries, Surabaya seems to be one of Majapahit ports or coastal settlements, together with Tuban, Gresik, and Hujung Galuh (Sidoarjo). Ma Huan documented the early 15th-century visit of Zheng He's treasure ships in his 1433 book Yingya Shenglan: "after traveling south for more than 20 li, the ship reached Sulumayi, whose foreign name is Surabaya. At the estuary, the outflowing water is fresh".[26]Tomé Pires mentioned that a Muslim lord was in power in Surabaya in 1513, though likely still a vassal of the Majapahit.Ma Huan visited Java during Zheng He's fourth expedition in the 1413, during the reign of Majapahit king Wikramawardhana. He describes his travel to Majapahit capital, first he arrived to the port of Tu-pan (Tuban) where he saw large numbers of Chinese settlers migrated from Guangdong and Chou Chang. Then, he sailed east to thriving new trading town of Ko-erh-hsi (Gresik), Su-pa-erh-ya (Surabaya), and then sailing inland into the river by smaller boat to southwest until reached the Brantas river port of Chang-ku (Changgu). Continuing to travel by land to the southwest, he arrived in Man-che-po-I (Majapahit), where the Javanese king stayed.[27]Precolonial era[edit]By late 15th century, Islam began to take its root in Surabaya. The settlement of Ampel Denta, located around Ampel Mosque in today Ampel subdistrict, Semampir district, north Surabaya, was established by a charismatic Islamic proselytizer Sunan Ampel.[28]In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to be a duchy, a major political and military power in eastern Java. The Portuguese writer Tomé Pires mentioned that a Muslim lord was in power in Surabaya in 1513, though likely still a vassal of the Hindu–Buddhist Majapahit.[9] At that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port,[29] owing to its location on the River Brantas delta and on the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea.[30] During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate, and only submitted to its rule in 1530.[9][10] Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546.[11][12]The Duchy of Surabaya entered a conflict with, and was later captured by, the more powerful Sultanate of Mataram in 1625 under Sultan Agung.[31]:31 It was one of Mataram's fiercest campaigns, in which they had to conquer Surabaya's allies, Sukadana and Madura, and to lay siege to the city before capturing it. With this conquest, Mataram then controlled almost the whole of Java, with the exception of the Sultanate of Banten and the Dutch settlement of Batavia.[31]:31Colonial era[edit]The expanding Dutch East India Company took the city over from a weakened Mataram in November 1743. In consolidating its rule over Surabaya, and in time, the rest of East Java, the Dutch collaborated with leading regional magnates, including Ngabehi Soero Pernollo (1720–1776), his brother Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727–1778), and the latter's son, Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759–1827), all from the powerful Han family of Lasem.[32][33]In the 18th and 19th centuries, Surabaya was the largest city in Dutch East Indies. It became a major trading centre under the Dutch colonial government, and hosted the largest naval base in the colony. Surabaya was also the largest city in the colony serving as the centre of Java's plantation economy, industry and were supported by its natural harbour.[34] In 1920, a census recorded that Batavia had become the largest city. In 1917, a revolt occurred among the soldiers and sailors of Surabaya, led by the Indies Social Democratic Association. The revolt was firmly crushed and the insurgents given harsh sentences.[35]Independence era[edit]  The burnt-out car of Brigadier Mallaby on the spot where he was killed by pro-independence Indonesian soldiers during the Battle of Surabaya on 31 October 1945Japan occupied the city in 1942, as part of the occupation of Indonesia, and it was bombed by the Allies in 1944. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, Surabaya was seized by Indonesian nationalists. The young nation soon came into conflict with the British, who had become caretakers of the Dutch colony after the surrender of the Japanese.[36]The Battle of Surabaya, one of the well-known battles of the Indonesian revolution, started after the Arek-Arek Suroboyo (Teenagers of Surabaya) assassinated the British Brigadier Mallaby on 30 October 1945, near Jembatan Merah (the "Red Bridge"), allegedly with a stray bullet. The Allies gave an ultimatum to the Republicans inside the city to surrender, but they refused. The ensuing battle, which cost thousands of lives, took place on 10 November, which Indonesians subsequently celebrate as Hari Pahlawan (Heroes' Day). The incident of the red-white flag (the Dutch flag at the top of Yamato Hotel's tower that was torn into the Indonesian red-white flag) by Bung Tomo is also recorded as a heroic feat during the struggle of this city.[37]The city is known as Kota Pahlawan  (city of heroes) due to the importance of the Battle of Surabaya in galvanising Indonesian and international support for Indonesian independence during the Indonesian National Revolution.[38]In June 2011, Surabaya received the Adipura Kencana Award as number one among 20 cities in Indonesia. Surabaya was reported by a Singaporean as being clean and green.[39]Geography[edit]Topography[edit]  Outskirt areas of SurabayaSurabaya is located on the northern coast of East Java province.

One of the parks in Surabaya, Bungkul Park, in 2013 was awarded the Asian Townscape Award 2013 from the United Nations as the best park in Asia because of its very complete and integrated facilities, starting from the economic area (street food centers), green open area, parks , disability-friendly area, free internet (Wi-Fi), and routine garden maintenance management.[49]The city of Surabaya is very outstanding in the field of environment.[50] The city has won many awards in the field of environment and city planning both on a national and international scale.[51] The awards that were successfully received by Surabaya included adipura, adipura kencana, adiwiyata, wahyu tata nugraha, and other green awards. The Adipura Cup, which was once received by Surabaya, was in 1980s and 1990s for several times, the Adipura Kencana trophy, the cleanest metropolitan city category in the 1990s and in the period of 2010 to 2017, seven consecutive times, as well as the Adipura trophy. plenary in 2016.[52] The city also received several awards from the central government as one of the major cities with the best air quality in Indonesia.[53] Surabaya in 2012 has won the award "City of the Best Participation in the Asia Pacific" by Citynet for the success of the city government and people's participation in managing the environment. Surabaya has also been awarded the ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City Award or "the city with the best sustainable environmental management in ASEAN" in 2011 and 2014.[54] In 2018, Surabaya won the Lee Kuan Yew City Prize along with Hamburg, Germany; Kazan, Russia; and Tokyo, Japan. This award was obtained because Surabaya is considered to be one of the major cities in the world that is able to maintain and manage villages in the middle of the city with excellent government management and community participation amid the rapidly developing city.[55] Surabaya became the first city in Indonesia to receive this award.[55] This award was received directly by the Mayor Tri Rismaharini in Singapore in July 2018.[55] However, despite all that, on the other hand there are not a few areas in Surabaya that still look less organized, especially in the neighbourhoods of Southern Surabaya and Northern Surabaya.[56][57] This is the concern of the city government to reorganize the environment of the region.[58]Government[edit]  Surabaya City Hall at dusk.The city has its own local government and legislative body. The mayor and members of representatives are locally elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The city government enjoys greater decentralization of affairs than the provincial body, such as the provision of public schools, public health facilities, and public transportation. Current mayor of the city is Tri Rismaharini, the first female mayor in Surabaya, and has led Surabaya to achieve many regional, national and international awards since her first term as Surabaya Mayor in 2010. In 2012 Surabaya was awarded the "ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City Award". Besides Mayor and Vice Mayor, there is Surabaya Municipal People's Representative Council, which is a legislative body of 50 council members directly elected by the people in legislative elections every five years.[59]The city administration maintains a central command center since 2016, integrating all civic services including Satpol PP, Bakesbangpol and Linmas, Hygiene and Parks Service, Transportation Agency, Public Works Agency of Highways and Extermination, ambulance and fire services.[60][61] All services can be accessed by dialing 112 number. The city is dubbed as the champion of smart city in Indonesia and won Indonesia Smart City Index (IKCI) in 2015 and 2018.[62] The City of Heroes also received an award at the Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation in the Online Popular City category and Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize in 2018.[63]Surabaya is divided into 31 kecamatan (districts),[64][65] and 161 kelurahan (subdistricts). The districts are grouped into five areas: Central, North, South, East, and West. The districts are: Karang Pilang (72,469)Jambangan (46,430)Gayungan (42,717)Wonocolo (80,276)Tenggilis Mejoyo (72,467)Gunung Anyar (62,120)Rungkut (121,084)Sukolilo (119,873)Mulyorejo (94,728)Gubeng (128,127)Wonokromo (133,211) Dukuh Pakis (64,249)Wiyung (67,987)Lakarsantri (51,195)Sambikerep (61,101)Tandes (103,084)Sukomanunggal (100,612)Sawahan (170,605)Tegalsari (85,606)Genteng (46,548)Tambaksari (204,805) Kenjeran (163,438)Bulak, Surabaya (37,214)Simokerto (79,319)Semampir (151,429)Pabean Cantian (69,423)Bubutan (84,465)Krembangan (106,664)Asemrowo (42,704)Benowo (54,133)Pakal (47,404) Demographics[edit]  The metropolitan area in 2014, seen from the International Space Station, the brightest section are Surabaya and its metropolitan areasHistorical populationYearPop.±%1883122,000—    1897142,980+17.2%1900150,000+4.9%1930341,700+127.8%1940403,000+17.9%1945618,000+53.3%1949500,000−19.1%1950715,000+43.0%1955808,267+13.0%19611,008,000+24.7%19651,183,851+17.4%19711,556,255+31.5%19802,008,335+29.0%19902,467,089+22.8%20002,610,519+5.8%20102,768,225+6.0%20153,457,409+24.9%Source: Various sources1883–1961 : Surabaya: City of Work[66] 1897 : New International Encyclopedia[67] 1930 : Workers, Unions and Politics: Indonesia in the 1920s and 1930s[68] 1965 : World Population Review[69] 1971–2010 : Statistics Indonesia (BPS) 2015 : citypopulation.de (estimated)Surabaya is the second-most populous city in Indonesia, with 3,457,409 recorded in the chartered city limits (kota) in the 2015 census.[70] With the extended metropolitan development area called Gerbangkertosusila (derived from Gresik-Bangkalan-Mojokerto-Surabaya-Sidoarjo-Lamongan) adding more than 12 million inhabitants in several cities and around 50 districts spread over noncontiguous urban areas including Gresik, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, and Pasuruan regencies. Though central government of Indonesia recognizes only the metropolitan area (Surabaya, Gresik, and Sidarjo) as Greater Surabaya (Zona Surabaya Raya) with a population of 8,319,229 (2015), making Surabaya now the second-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia.[71] The city is highly urbanized, with industries centralized in the city, and contains slums.  As the main education centre, the city is also home for students from around Indonesia.[72]Surabaya is an old city that has expanded over time, and its population continues to grow at roughly 2.2% per year. In recent years, more people have moved to Surabaya from nearby suburbs and villages in East Java.[73]Ethnicity[edit]Ethnic Javanese people are the majority in Surabaya and ethnic Madurese being significant minorities in the city.[74] Surabaya also has ethnic populations from other parts of Indonesia: Sundanese, Minang, Batak, Banjar, Balinese, and Bugis.
