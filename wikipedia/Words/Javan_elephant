It is now extinct.[1] It became extinct in the 18th century.[citation needed] The Sultan of Java[which?] was reported to have made a gift of Javan elephants to the Sultan of Sulu before they became extinct. It had been thought quite recently that the elephants in Borneo could be descendants of those animals.[2] However, recent DNA analysis suggests that the Borneo elephants have been there for thousands of years.[3]See also[edit]Borneo elephantSumatran elephantAsian elephantIndian elephantSri Lankan elephantElephas hysudrindicusReferences[edit]^ a b Shoshani, J.
