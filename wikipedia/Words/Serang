The city is located towards the north of Banten province, on the island of Java.  Before Banten province was formed in 2000 Serang was part of West Java province.Serang has a tropical rainforest climate, with no dry season month.[2]  It faces the Java Sea, which is home to Thousand Islands.Serang was reported as having a population of 576,961 in the 2010 census,[3] making it the third most populous city in the province of Banten. The latest official population estimate is 666,600 (2017) [4]. Serang is located approximately 15 km from the border of Jabodetabek and sometimes considered as amalgamated with the Greater Jakarta.Contents1 Culture2 Transportation3 Administrative districts4 Emblem5 ReferencesCulture[edit]Religion The majority of people in Serang  and Banten Province embrace Islam, but other religions coexist peacefully.Language Compared with the majority in Banten Province who speak the Sundanese language, local people in Serang speak the  Javanese language with a dialect similar to the Cirebon dialect of Javanese. The reason for this is that many Javanese migrants arrived in early 1527 to build the Banten Sultanate, and remained to form the base of today's population.Transportation[edit]The city is served by Serang Station, operated by Indonesia's rail operator PT Kereta Api.The Tangerang–Merak Toll Road, part of the Trans-Java toll road, passes through the city of Serang.The road to the proposed Sunda Strait Bridge would start in Serang, pass through Merak in neighboring Cilegon city to cross over the Sunda Strait to Sumatra.Administrative districts[edit]Serang was formerly a part of Serang Regency.
